### New and Fresh porfolio website!

Welcome to my second version of my website! This has been in almost a year of on-and-off development. I used a variety of tools to make everything work and flow. I'm not much of a designer myself but I tried my best to make the website look even a little visually interesting.

## Tools used
React, Framer-motion, THREE.js, chakra-ui, gh-pages, fontsource (Balsamiq-sans and Poppins).
